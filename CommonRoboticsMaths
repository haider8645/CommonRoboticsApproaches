| **Monte Carlo Localization** | A probabilistic technique for robot localization using random sampling, particularly effective in partially observable environments. | Widely employed in robotics for accurate localization when dealing with uncertainty.                   |
| **Motion Planning Algorithms** | Algorithms that generate collision-free paths for robots through complex environments, such as A* search, RRT, and PRM. | Critical for autonomous navigation and manipulation tasks, ensuring robots avoid obstacles and reach goals safely. |
| **Workspace**            | The 3D or 2D space in which a robot operates, defined by the reach of its end-effector or joints.              | Understanding and defining the workspace is crucial for robot design, task planning, and avoiding workspace limitations. |
| **Degrees of Freedom (DOF)** | The number of independent parameters required to specify the configuration of a robot, such as joint angles. | Describes a robot's mobility and flexibility, influencing its ability to perform specific tasks and motions.          |
| **Haptic Feedback**       | The use of touch and force feedback to provide sensory information to a robot operator or user.              | Enhances human-robot interaction, enabling users to perceive and control robotic systems more effectively.         |
